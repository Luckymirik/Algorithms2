# Algorithms2
Educational project. 2nd course. "Basics of Algorithms, Part 2."
Write another implementation of the interface from the previous homework, but with additional methods.
Necessary:
1. Write a second implementation of the list interface (copy and adjust the first) to “fit” it for working with integers, using the Integer reference type.
   
2.Add to the implementation a private method with the fastest sorting considered.
Please note that to compare sortings you need to use 3 different copies of the array, since it is incorrect to sort a previously sorted array.
Attach the comparison code itself if desired.

3. Add a private binary search method to the implementation.
